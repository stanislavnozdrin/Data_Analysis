# Data_Analysis
The repository is devoted to improving my skills in Data analysis and craving attemption to not forget all the thin moments of it.

It includes next parts:
- Works and files are from the university practice, lectures, tasks
- My own matters and wishes 

I hope it will include next items in the future:
- All species of hypothesis 
- Variance analysis
- Statistics matters(building intervals, boxplots, histograms and e.t.c)
- Cluster analysis view 
- Factor analysis, PCA(kernel+), SVD
- Working with a data(preproccesing, missing gaps and e.t.c)
